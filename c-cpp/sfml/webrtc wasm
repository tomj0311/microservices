The full WebRTC stack includes video/audio streaming with vp8/vp9/h264 codecs & data is packaged using RTP. 
Well WebRTC is generally p2p, however you could setup a "Server Peer" and designate it as having a source channel only (ie there is no input channel).This peer then becomes the "server" and all the other peers can view its contents when they connect.
