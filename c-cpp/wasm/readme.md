Live demo: https://timhutton.github.io/sdl-canvas-wasm/

(If you want more sophisticated drawing than SDL can offer (e.g. 3D), then you should probably start [here](https://github.com/timhutton/opengl-canvas-wasm) instead.) 

Instructions:
-------------

1. Install Emscripten:

    http://emscripten.org

2. Clone this repo:

    ```git clone https://github.com/timhutton/sdl-canvas-wasm.git```
    
    ```cd sdl-canvas-wasm```
    
3. Build index.js and index.wasm:

    ```emcc core.cpp -s WASM=1 -s USE_SDL=2 -O3 -o index.js```

4. Open index.html in a web browser. You should see a moving blue square in a red square:

    Chrome doesn't support file:// XHR requests, so you need to first start a webserver, e.g.:

    with Python 2: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080```
    
    with Python 3: ```python -m http.server 8080```

    and then open this URL:

    http://localhost:8080/
