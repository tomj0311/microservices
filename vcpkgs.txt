abseil               2019-05-08-1     an open-source collection designed to augment the C++ standard library.
  Abseil is an open-source collection of C++ library code designed to augment the C++ standard library. The Abseil library code is collected from Google's own C++ code base, has been extensively tested and used in production, and is the same code we depend on in our daily coding lives.
  In some cases, Abseil provides pieces missing from the C++ standard; in others, Abseil provides alternatives to the standard for special needs we've found through usage in the Google code base. We denote those cases clearly within the library code we provide you.
  Abseil is not meant to be a competitor to the standard library; we've just found that many of these utilities serve a purpose within our code base, and we now want to provide those resources to the C++ community as a whole.

azmq                 1.0.2            Boost Asio style bindings for ZeroMQ
  This library is built on top of ZeroMQ's standard C interface and is intended to work well with C++ applications which use the Boost libraries in general, and Asio in particular.
  The main abstraction exposed by the library is azmq::socket which provides an Asio style socket interface to the underlying zeromq socket and interfaces with Asio's io_service(). The socket implementation participates in the io_service's reactor for asynchronous IO and may be freely mixed with other Asio socket types (raw TCP/UDP/Serial/etc.).
